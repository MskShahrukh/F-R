# Fine & Rare Test

In this small project, we can fetch products from an external CSV file, store it into our mongoDB, and berform some queries and mutations.

Running the project is relatively simple. Just follow the steps below..

- run `npm install` on project root
- run `npm run dev`

And that's it.

On your terminal you will see some info regarding GraphQL endpoint and playground.. as such

```
Server started on port 3000
Running a GraphQL API server at http://localhost:3000/graphql
GraphQL playground at http://localhost:3000/playground
```

There is a playground-helper.txt file which you can paste in the playground to speed up your testing.
